🌊 I am an Artificial Intelligence MSc student at Bocconi University.
🏔️ Prior to this, I did my BSc in Economic and Social Sciences also at Bocconi. During my BSc, I worked as a research assistant for Prof. Massimo Marinacci in the field of theoretical economics and mathematics. 
☀️ I also studied General Biology and Genetics for my personal interest at Università di Milano.

In my GitHub profile you will find the projects I have worked on. I hope you find them interesting, and if you do, feel free to reach out anytime!

More:
I am very curious and always eager to understand how things work! My main academical interests lie at the intersection between Computer Science, Mathematics and Econometrics.
Alongside Maths, I love spending time with friends and in nature, doing sports, like volleyball, surfing, and skiing.
