More about me:  
My main academical interest lies at the intersection between Computer Science, Mathematics and Econometrics.
I am very curious and always fascinated by the deep understanding of how things work!  
Alongside Maths, I love spending time with friends and in nature, doing sports, like volleyball, surfing, and skiing.
